# angular2-webpack-seed

An Angular2 Webpack seed.

#USAGE

Run `node server` in one console, then `webpack --watch` in another one.

Open up the browser-sync proxy of your express server in the specified port (read the console, usually `http://localhost:3000`). It will reload the page after every webpack compilation (in watch mode).
